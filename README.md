    <td>Node v12.x -> v18.x</td>
    <td>
      I've tried using v12.x with vue2 AND nuxt v2.0.0, seemed incompatible with node v12.x (if it actually was possible, I couldnt get the solution). I have tried many ways to made it run, but I always stuck at yarn dev (node:fs is required error). Therefore, I will use Node v18.x (current LTS version) in order for this project to proceed.
